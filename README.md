## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

Study them *in this exact order* before moving to any specialization:

**I. Foundations of Political Science**: Start here. This section teaches you how to think, read, and write like a political scientist.

**II. Political Science Methods (Foundational)**: Next, learn the basic tools researchers use to study politics seriously (both qualitative and quantitative).

**III. Political Theory (Global Foundations)**: Then build your understanding of the big ideas that have shaped political thinking across time and places.

**IV. Political Institutions & Comparative Politics**: Finish the core by learning how political systems are actually organized and how they differ across countries.

### Specialization Tracks

You do **not** need to study all of them. You can study **one track** deeply, **several tracks** at a lighter level, or even return later to explore more. There is no required order among the specialization tracks—choose based on your curiosity.

The specialization tracks are:

- **V. Political Behavior & Identity**: how ordinary people think, vote, and form political identities.
- **VI. International Relations & Global Politics**: war, peace, diplomacy, global power, and relations between countries.
- **VII. Political Economy & Development**: money, markets, inequality, why some countries grow rich while others stay poor. 
- **VIII. Public Policy, Administration & Governance**: how governments actually make and implement decisions, laws, regulations, and city policies
