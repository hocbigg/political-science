You do **not** need to study all of them. You can study **one track** deeply, **several tracks** at a lighter level, or even return later to explore more. There is no required order among the specialization tracks—choose based on your curiosity.

The specialization tracks are:

- **Political Behavior & Identity**: how ordinary people think, vote, and form political identities.
- **International Relations & Global Politics**: war, peace, diplomacy, global power, and relations between countries.
- **Political Economy & Development**: money, markets, inequality, why some countries grow rich while others stay poor. 
- **Public Policy, Administration & Governance**: how governments actually make and implement decisions, laws, regulations, and city policies
